# angelcad-samples

This repository contains AngelCAD sample scripts. AngelCAD scripts are based on the [AngelScript](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_script.html) language with extensions for Constructive Solid Geometry.

The samples in the main folder produce 3d objects and are useful as introduction to AngelCAD.
